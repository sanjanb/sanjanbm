## About

I'm a student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science & AI/ML Engineering at ATME College of Engineering in Mysore, with a CGPA of 9.23 so far. I focus on building [AI tools](https://github.com/sanjanb) that tackle real issues, like automating workflows or analyzing data through machine learning.

I see myself as someone who blends hands-on coding with leadership in student groups, keeping my work grounded in practical applications while exploring new tech.

## Experience

### SynerSense Pvt. Ltd.
**Vision Language Model Developer and Research Intern**
[https://sanjanb.github.io/](https://sanjanb.github.io/)

I'm building vision-language pipelines using CLIP and custom VLMs, integrating visual embeddings into MLP classifiers to improve multi-modal accuracy by about 18% on benchmarks.

I've also written over 25 pages of technical docs on GitHub Pages to speed up onboarding, and set up MLflow for tracking more than 50 experiments, making comparisons easier.

This role sharpens my research skills, but is early specialization assuming VLMs are the future? Maybe, though diversifying into edge AI could add versatility.

### IEEE CS Society – IAMPro
**Deep Learning Project Intern**

I'm developing AI models for pest detection with image recognition, boosting early detection by around 22% over basic CNNs.

I used over 20k records of climatic and soil data for crop yield predictions, hitting a 15% accuracy gain, and prototyped generative AI for augmenting limited datasets plus robotics concepts for farming.

It ties into sustainable tech, but does assuming data abundance always work? In real fields, sparse data might challenge that—perhaps more focus on transfer learning could help.

### IEEE ATME Student Branch
**Vice Chair**

I'm leading over five workshops and hackathons on AI/ML, engaging more than 500 students, and coordinating industry talks to bring in fresh insights. This builds on my open-source contributions through SWOC and GirlScript.

Am I relying on these for resume boosts? It's valid for networking, but another view: It might dilute time for personal coding. The logic checks if it leads to collaborations, though I'd track how many turn into ongoing projects.

### NCompass TechStudio
**Software Developer**

From my resume, I also had a Software Developer role at NCompass TechStudio as an entry into dev work, with a move to Ahmedabad. That highlights adaptability, but was the assumption that in-person opportunities trump remote ones accurate, or could staying put have allowed deeper focus on studies?

## In Between These Experiences

### The Project Building Journey

My projects show a progression from basics to more integrated systems. It started with the **Admission Automation System**, a national hackathon winner where I built an AI setup with OCR (Tesseract), NLP, and a custom SLM via DistilBERT for data extraction, hitting over 95% accuracy and cutting verification time by 60%. Used FastAPI for scalable pipelines.

Then the **AI-Powered CTI System**, co-developing NLP for threat intel with spaCy and Transformers, automating IOC extraction at 90% accuracy, plus a FastAPI backend and Docker for deployment.

**GAN for Fashion Item Generation** followed, using TensorFlow and Keras to create realistic images, improving quality by 25% with tweaks like LeakyReLU, and MLflow for experiments.

**BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis** fine-tuned BERT on 50k IMDB reviews for 94% accuracy, including preprocessing and bias investigation via augmentation.

Recent GitHub activity in February 2026 includes heavy commits to lifelab (111), follow-through-challenge (44), and my-digital-garden (42), leaning into productivity tools. With 4,526 contributions last year, mostly private, it's about consistency. But is quantity trumping quality? Some being forks suggest building on existing work—pushing more originals could shift that. Logic: Each iteration teaches, like stability in GANs, but public feedback might refine faster.

**So yes, each step builds on the last, even if early ones feel rough now.**

## Education

### ATME College of Engineering, Mysore
**Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science & AI/ML Engineering (Hons.)**
Nov 2022 - Present
CGPA: 9.23
Core subjects include Deep Learning, Python for Data Science, Data Structures, DBMS, OS, Probability, Discrete Structures. Am I assuming high grades guarantee opportunities? They help, but real-world impact from projects might matter more in hiring.

## Research Publications

### Research Contributions
**Under ATME**

I haven't listed full publications yet, but contributed to AI/ML research with papers submitted under ATME, focusing on deep learning and NLP. As a "Published Researcher" award notes, it's a start—submitting to journals could formalize it.

## Tech Stack

Python (Advanced), C (Intermediate), SQL (Intermediate), Java, TypeScript, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Hugging Face Transformers, MLflow, FastAPI, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Git, GitHub, Jupyter, VS Code, Google Colab, Docker, MongoDB

## Recommendations by Clients

Not publicly detailed yet, but my hackathon wins and IEEE role imply strong feedback. Collecting endorsements on LinkedIn would strengthen this.

## Explainer Videos

No dedicated channel, but demos paired with my blog posts could explain projects like the CTI system—YouTube would make them more accessible.

## Writings & Blogs

I share thoughts on my portfolio site, keeping it simple.
- [My AI/ML Specialization Journey: From Foundations to Advanced LLM Applications](https://sanjanb.github.io/) (Sep 13, 2025)
- [Advanced Blog Formatting Guide: Mastering Jekyll and al-folio Techniques](https://sanjanb.github.io/) (Jan 15, 2025)

Is a personal site assuming enough reach? Medium could expand audience, but control here is key. Adding project deep-dives, like bias in BERT, would add value.

## Thing About Me

Outside tech, I'm a Kaggle Practitioner since May 2024, competing in ML/DL challenges for preprocessing and ensemble skills. I also volunteer in community efforts, drawing from awards like Best Student for extracurriculars. It keeps me balanced, but is it automatic? Scheduling non-tech time prevents burnout.
