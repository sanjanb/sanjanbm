## In Between These Experiences

### The Product Building Journey

I've been building and experimenting on the product side for a long time. Each previous product always feels naive in hindsight, but looking back, I can see they were incrementally better, each iteration teaching me something new about users, infrastructure, and what it takes to build something people actually want.

It started with **MetaWiper** during my sophomore year, a tool that cleaned image metadata. No one would use it, but I was proud. It was my first real attempt at shipping something complete.

Next came **Stockic**, a news app where I spent months doing serious infrastructure work. This was where I learned to build systems that could scale, not just features that looked good.

Then I worked on **Gloss Card**, and for the first time, a customer actually wanted to buy it for their product. That validation, knowing someone saw enough value to pay, was a turning point.

After that, I built **NeuraLeap**, where I had the most meaningful user interactions yet, HRs from established firms. I worked on data pipelines capable of handling 50 million LinkedIn profiles and processing them with AI. The scale was different, the stakes were higher, and the technical challenges forced me to level up.

Most recently, I worked on **Meteor**, an AI SEO toolkit at Entrepreneurs First. This time, my product was being used by 6 YC-backed companies. Real users. Real traction. Real feedback loops.

**So yes, hard work and consistency pay off. Each product was a step forward, even when it didn't feel like it at the time.**

### Cross-Compatible Encryption Adapter for Securing Legacy Modbus Devices
**2025 17th International Conference on COMmunication Systems and NETworks (COMSNETS)**
Authors: Aditya Patil; T. S. Sreeram
[https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSNETS63942.2025.10885597](https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSNETS63942.2025.10885597)

**Abstract:**
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems are the backbone of managing critical infrastructure in modern industrial control systems, spanning sectors from power generation to logistics. However, these systems face significant challenges due to threats from malicious actors. The Modbus protocol, despite its known lack of security features, is still used in many industries managing critical infrastructure due to the high cost of replacing existing systems. As a result, these legacy systems remain vulnerable to potentially damaging threats. This paper proposes an adapter device for enhancing the security of the Modbus protocol without replacing devices in legacy systems. The proposed adapter is cost-efficient, provides cross-platform support, and is easy to install, update, and maintain.
